What Is Data Science?

Data science, despite its hype- laden veneer, is perhaps the best label we have for the cross-disciplinary set of skills that are becoming increasingly important in many applications across industry and academia.

Think of data science not as a new domain of knowledge to learn, but a new set of skills that you can apply within your current area of expertise. Whether you are reporting election results, forecasting stock returns, optimizing online ad clicks, identifying microorganisms in microscope photos, seeking new classes of astronomical objects, or working with data in any
other field, the goal of this book is to give you the ability to ask and answer new ques‚Äê tions about your chosen subject area.

Why Python?

Python has emerged over the past couple of decades as a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets. 

The usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages: 
NumPy for manipulation of homogeneous array- based data, 
Pandas for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, 
SciPy for common scientific computing tasks, 
Matplotlib for publication-quality visualizations, 
IPython for interactive execution and sharing of code, 
Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and 
many more tools.
